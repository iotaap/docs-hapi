new firmware using [IoTaaP Console](https://console.iotaap.io/), and defining different version (e.g. 1.0.2 to 1.0.3) your device (or devices, in case of group OTA) 
will start with firmware download and upgrade process (default OTA Update pooling period is 30 seconds). Device will automatically restart, and start with publishing its status instantly.
