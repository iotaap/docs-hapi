# OTA Update

With HAPI you have the possibility to upgrade your device's firmware remotely. Shortily after uploading your 
new firmware using [IoTaaP Console](https://console.iotaap.io/), and defining different version (e.g. 1.0.2 to 1.0.3) your device (or devices, in case of group OTA) 
will start with firmware download and upgrade process. Device will automatically restart, and start with publishing its status instantly. 

!!! danger "Firmware"
    You must upload only firmware.bin file that is generated by PlatformIO. **You have to keep ID, token
    and OTA information in the new firmware version** otherwise you will lose the possibility to monitor, control
    or update your devices remotely!
